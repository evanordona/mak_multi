# Mage Archer Knight (Lords Duel)

## Description
Mage Archer Knight is a strategic game that adds a twist to the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors concept. Players take on the roles of powerful characters: Mages, Archers, and Knights. Each beats a different character and loses to the other.

In this game, instead of a simple win-lose outcome, each character has a value assigned to them, ranging from 1 to 8. Mages wield powerful magic but are vulnerable to the swift attacks of the Archers. Archers, in turn, must beware the armored Knights, whose defense can withstand their arrows. Knights, while formidable in defense, must tread carefully around the magical abilities of Mages.

Players select their character, each round, aiming to outwit their opponent by choosing a character that can overcome the other's choice based on their values. A win is defined by having at least one point in every category or by having three points in any category.

This game is similar to Club Penguins card-jitsu!
